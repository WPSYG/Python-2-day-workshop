There will be break-out sessions where you can get comfortable with what you have learnt. This will ensure that you fully understand the various aspects of the tutorial and give you room to ask your questions. In this course, you will perform arithmetic operations on numbers, import python packages for solving different programming problems and also get creative in solving some specific tasks. "

        "1. [Web development](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-development.html) – Web framework like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) are based on Python. They help you write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic, mapping urls etc.\n",

        "2. [Machine learning](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/) – There are many machine learning applications written in Python. Machine learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user’s interest. Face recognition and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning.\n",

        "3. [Data Analysis](http://www.data-analysis-in-python.org/) – Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be developed using Python."
