    "For this course, you will be introduced to the Python programming language and we will be walking through different tutorials in a step-by-step fashion. There will be break-out sessions where you can get comfortable with what you have learnt. This will ensure you fully understand the various aspects of the tutorial and you will be able to ask your questions in those rooms. In this course, you will perform arithmetic operations on numbers, import python packages for solving different programming problems and also get creative in solving some specific tasks. "
